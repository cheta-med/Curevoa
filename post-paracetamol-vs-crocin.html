  <h1>Paracetamol vs Crocin: Are They the Same?</h1>
  <p><strong>Posted on:</strong> July 15, 2025</p>

  <p>Many people ask — is Crocin the same as Paracetamol? The answer is yes and no. Crocin is a branded version of Paracetamol made by GSK.</p>

  <p><strong>Paracetamol</strong> is the generic name of the drug, while <strong>Crocin</strong> is one of its brand names. Both contain the same active ingredient and are used to reduce fever and mild pain.</p>

  <p>However, pricing, packaging, and combinations (like Crocin Cold & Flu) may vary. Always read the label and ask your doctor before use.</p>
